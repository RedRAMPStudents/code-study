# Intro

Hello! This is a project done by a subgroup of [RAMP 2020](https://www.uml.edu/engineering/ramp/) affiliated with the EECE department of the University of Massachusetts Lowell. 
This is the final project for students in the Intro to Engineering course and functions as a collabrative study help tool. This project uses a combination of Adafruit, Energia, 
and digilent arduino boards. 

The developers are: Sarah Eagen, Julia Measmer, Nathan Uhunsere, Rishabh Dhir, and Victoria Nguyen. 

# Instructions
## Create Adafruit Feeds for Study Buddy
1. Take note of **your** [Adafruit IO key](https://learn.adafruit.com/mqtt-adafruit-io-and-you/getting-started-on-adafruit-io)
2. Create a new feed that will record your study time data nd take note of the name of your feed
3. Create a feed that will record your type of study/joystick data and take note of the feed name (This will record numbers 1,2...) 
    1. Create a new feed that will use data from the feed you ade in step 3. This will change it from a number to words
    * Create a trigger - "If(Feed from step(3) is equal to "1" then set (Feed from (3i)) to "Test Prep"
    * Create another trigger - "If (Feed from step(3)) is equal to "1" then set (Feed from step(3)) then set (Feed from (3i)) to "Group Work"
    * Create another trigger - "If (Feed from step(3)) is equal to "3" then set (Feed from (3i)) to "Homework"
4. Share your feed from step(2) and (i) with the username (seags in our case) of whoever is hosting the shared Adafruit feeds 

## Setting up Energia Code
1. Download/copy Study Buddy Code!!! into Energia
2. Input your
    1. Wifi SSID line 34
    2. WiFi password line 36
    3. Adafruit Username into line 38
    4. **Your*** Adafruit IO key into line 40
3. Connect study buddy to your study time feed
    1. To send the length of the study session: Replace ("Neut/feeds/study-time") with your Adafruit username and feed name in line 289. 
    * Neut -> Adafruit username
    * study-time -> feed name
4.  To send the type of work: Connect study buddy to your Study Type/Joystick feed
    1. Replace ("Neut/feeds/study-typein") with your Adafruit username and feed name in line 373
    3. Repeat for line 380
    
## Setting up Zapier Bots: 
Firstly create a new Zap, then follow the prompts:
1. When this happens...
    1. Choose /Search for Adafruit IO
    * Choose Trigger -> Get Feed Data
    2. Choose your Adafruit account and insert your Adafruit IO key
    3. Select your feed from step(i)
    4. Select feed data A
2. Do this...
    1. Choose /Search for Discord app
    * Choose Action -> send a channel message
    2. Choose the account that you would like to use (in our case RedHat RAMP account) and log into your Discord
    3. Customize channel message to
    * Bot-channel (whatever channel that the bot should be in)
    * Message text "(your name) is doing" then select/insert data from Adafruit (1.Value)
    * Name your not "(your name)'s bot"
    2. Test and turn on your zap!

## Using Study Buddy
Assuming all other steps have been completed correctly
1. Plug in your Arduino board and upload the code
2. Open the serial moniter 
3. Once you are connected to the Wifi, hold button 1 and flick the joystick in the direction that corresponds with your work. The timer will begin counting
4. After your study period ends, the buzzer will sound signalling your break period. Press Button 1 to turn off the buzzer and start the break period
5. Repeat this action at the end of your break period to begin your study period again
6. If you need to pause, press the joystick button, then press it again to unpause
7. To end your session, press button 2
8. To reset and start a new study session, press the button on the launch pad
